## The Google Cloud Trust Principles and Transparency Reports

At Google, transparency is key to building confidence in our services. Google Cloud’s trust principles ensure the security and control of your business data. Here’s a summary of these principles:

1. **Data Ownership**: You own your data and have full control over access, export, deletion, and permissions.
2. **No Data Sales**: Google does not sell customer data to third parties or use it for marketing.
3. **Confidentiality**: Customer data is not used for advertising, ensuring its confidentiality.
4. **Default Encryption**: All customer data is encrypted by default to protect against unauthorized access.
5. **Insider Access Protection**: Strict measures are in place to prevent unauthorized employee access to your data.
6. **No Government Backdoors**: Google does not provide any government entity with backdoor access to your data.
7. **Regular Audits**: Our privacy practices are audited against international standards for compliance.

Google Cloud also offers transparency reports and undergoes independent audits, reinforcing our commitment to trust, accountability, and robust data protection principles, including participation in initiatives like the EU Cloud Code of Conduct.

## Data residency and data sovereignty

Data sovereignty and data residency are crucial concepts for data security. 

- **Data Sovereignty** refers to the legal requirement that data is subject to the laws of the country where it is located. For instance, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates compliance with data protection laws for any personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where it is processed.

- **Data Residency** pertains to the physical location of data storage or processing. Some countries require that their citizens' personal data be stored within national borders to ensure it falls under local laws.

Google Cloud addresses these concepts by offering options to control data location through various regions, each with multiple data centers. Users can select specific regions within the EU, such as the UK, Belgium, or Germany, to ensure compliance with data residency laws.

Additionally, Google Cloud provides Organization Policy constraints and IAM configurations to prevent accidental data storage in incorrect regions. Features like VPC Service Controls and Google Cloud Armor further enhance security by restricting network access based on defined parameters.

By leveraging these capabilities, organizations can meet data residency and sovereignty requirements, ensuring compliance and maintaining control over their data within Google Cloud.

## Industry and regional compliance

As organizations transition to the cloud, protecting sensitive workloads and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements is crucial. Non-compliance can lead to significant consequences, so Google Cloud provides robust resources to assist with compliance.

1. **Google Cloud Compliance Resource Center**: This hub offers detailed information on certifications and compliance standards, mapping Google Cloud's security, privacy, and compliance controls to global standards. It helps organizations navigate complex regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare and PCI DSS for the financial sector.

2. **Compliance Reports Manager**: This tool provides on-demand access to critical compliance resources, including ISO/IEC certificates and SOC reports, at no extra cost. It simplifies the certification process by allowing enterprises to efficiently access necessary documentation.

By utilizing these resources, organizations can effectively meet their regulatory obligations with the support of Google Cloud's compliance teams, ensuring a robust compliance posture.
