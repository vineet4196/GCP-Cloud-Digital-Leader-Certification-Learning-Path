**Course Introduction: Exploring Data Transformation with Google Cloud**

Business data is not a new concept; organizations have always used information about their performance to make decisions. However, traditional data analysis methods can take days or even months and often result in incomplete insights. Specialized teams are usually needed to create complex reports.

With cloud technology, things have changed. Now, data can be analyzed and used much faster and on a larger scale. Organizations can ingest data in real time to train machine learning models and make quick decisions that benefit their business.

You don’t need to be a data scientist or a technical expert to analyze data anymore. This course, “Exploring Data Transformation with Google Cloud,” aims to help you understand the value of data and its impact on customer experiences. You will learn about various Google Cloud data management solutions and discover how these products have made data more useful and accessible for everyone.

Throughout the course, there will be graded assessments that you need to pass to receive course credit.
