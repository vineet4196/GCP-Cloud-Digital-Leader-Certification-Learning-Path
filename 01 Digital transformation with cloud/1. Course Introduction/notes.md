## Executive Introduction

Vint Cerf, Vice President at Google, says that knowing about cloud technology is important for changing a business, but just having technical knowledge isn't enough. Leaders should understand what the cloud can do and how it can be used in their work. The cloud gives companies access to resources they might not be able to afford otherwise, so it’s important to keep up with new technologies. Leaders need to have a basic understanding of how these technologies can improve their products and services, as doing this well requires vision and good planning, not just technical skills.
