## What is cloud?

The cloud is a term that refers to a network of data centers that store and compute information available via the internet. It simplifies the complex infrastructure of software, servers, and security into one concept. 

Organizations can implement their IT infrastructure in several ways: on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and multicloud. 

1. **On-Premises**: This traditional setup involves hardware and software located within an organization's own data center. While it offers full control and doesn't require third-party access, it involves high costs and lengthy procurement processes, making it difficult to scale when demand increases.

2. **Private Cloud**: This cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, allowing for customization while still requiring maintenance similar to on-premises systems. It can be hosted on the organization’s own servers or through a private cloud provider.

3. **Public Cloud**: Managed by third-party providers like Google Cloud, this infrastructure is shared among multiple organizations. It provides on-demand computing services, allowing users to pay only for what they use. Public cloud services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

4. **Hybrid Cloud**: This setup combines both public and private cloud environments, allowing applications to run in different environments.

5. **Multicloud**: This strategy uses multiple public cloud providers and may also include on-premises solutions, often implementing both hybrid and multicloud strategies together.

Most organizations today adopt a multicloud strategy, with a significant percentage also using a hybrid approach, according to recent reports.

## The benefits of cloud computing

Cloud computing offers several advantages over traditional on-premises infrastructure:

1. **Scalability**: Organizations can access scalable resources and the latest technologies on demand, eliminating concerns about capital expenditures and fixed infrastructure. This speeds up infrastructure deployment.

2. **Flexibility**: Users can access cloud services from anywhere, easily scaling services up or down to meet business needs.

3. **Agility**: Organizations can quickly develop and launch new applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

4. **Strategic Value**: Cloud providers continuously update their offerings, allowing organizations to gain competitive advantages and better returns on investment compared to investing in soon-to-be outdated technologies.

5. **Security**: Cloud computing generally has stronger security than enterprise data centers due to comprehensive security measures and dedicated teams implemented by cloud providers.

6. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Organizations pay only for the resources they use, avoiding the need to overbuild data center capacity and allowing IT staff to focus on more strategic initiatives.

## Real-word examples: Why it's critical to transform and embrace new technology

As the world and businesses change, sticking to old technology without adapting is risky. Let's look at two examples: Nintendo and encyclopedia companies.

**Nintendo** has been in the gaming business since 1889, starting with traditional Japanese playing cards. They embraced new technologies to stay ahead, introducing gaming consoles and mobile devices. In 2016, they launched Pokémon Go, and in 2017, the Nintendo Switch, the first cloud gaming console. By using Google Cloud, Nintendo has expanded its reach, bringing games to smartphones worldwide. Their success comes from focusing on their mission: to make people play, rather than just on the technologies they use.

**In contrast**, encyclopedia companies focused too much on how they operated—like printing and selling physical books. They were proud of their beautiful, expensive books but lost sight of their mission to share knowledge. When new technologies like CD-ROMs emerged, they saw them as threats instead of opportunities. Many fell behind, while others like Britannica adapted by moving online.

Both Nintendo and encyclopedia companies started in the printing era, but their responses to new technologies led to very different outcomes. Digital transformation is an ongoing process, and industries worldwide, from healthcare to retail, are being disrupted by digitalization. It's crucial for organizations to see new technology as a chance to evolve, serve customers better, and gain a competitive edge. Here, cloud computing plays an important role.

## Cloud eras

To understand today’s cloud computing and true digital transformation, we need to look at how we got here.

It began with the **VM cloud era**, where startups realized they didn’t need to buy hardware and could operate entirely in the cloud. This led to the rise of major cloud-native companies like Twitter, Spotify, and PayPal. By the end of this era, most startups no longer managed their own data centers.

Next came the **infrastructure cloud era**. Organizations moved their IT infrastructure to the cloud, which saved costs and allowed for quicker scaling. Development became faster because companies didn't need to plan long-term infrastructure, and security improved. This shift also freed up IT staff to focus on new projects. Companies that didn’t migrate fell behind.

However, just moving systems to the cloud wasn’t enough for real change. Digital transformation is about changing how businesses operate, not just where. It requires using the cloud to maximize innovation.

Now, we are in the **transformation cloud era**, where organizations are not only making infrastructure choices but truly transforming their operations. This era promotes constant innovation across all teams.

To support this, many organizations are creating **transformation clouds**. These provide a platform for modernizing apps and infrastructure, democratizing data, connecting people, and ensuring trusted transactions. This approach helps organizations save money and create a sustainable future while driving innovation and quickly adapting to market changes.

## Challenges that lead to a digital transformation

A key sign of organizations speeding up their innovation is how they approach transformation. Instead of just asking where their apps and services should run, they focus on how to create an environment that helps everyone adapt to changing business needs.

At Google, when we discuss challenges with our customers, we identify five main themes driving digital transformation:

1. **Understanding Data**: Organizations want to unify their data from various sources to break down silos, gain real-time insights, and make better decisions, ultimately reducing costs.

2. **Technology Infrastructure**: They seek a flexible cloud platform that can support growth, innovation, and quick adaptation to market changes.

3. **Hybrid Workplace**: With changes in work patterns, there’s a need for stronger digital connections and collaboration, as many in-person interactions are now online.
