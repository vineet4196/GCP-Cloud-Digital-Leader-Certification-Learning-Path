## Total cost of ownership (TCO)

When organizations think about moving to the cloud, they often do a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. This analysis compares the costs of cloud adoption with the expenses of running their current on-premises systems.

For on-premises systems, TCO involves looking at the long-term costs of static resources. However, since the cloud is dynamic, predicting future costs can be tricky. A common mistake is to directly compare cloud costs with on-premises costs, as these aren’t the same.

On-premises costs mostly come from the initial purchase of hardware and software, while cloud costs usually involve monthly subscriptions or pay-per-use fees. Additionally, organizations need to consider operational costs of running their own data centers, like power, cooling, and maintenance.

Finally, it's crucial to factor in intangible costs, such as the missed opportunities and benefits that come from not migrating to the cloud.

## Capital expenditures (CapEx) versus operating expenses (OpEx)

**Cloud vs. Traditional IT: Cost Management Differences**

One major difference between cloud and traditional IT is in how costs are managed when moving to the cloud. 

**Shift from CapEx to OpEx:**  
Organizations transition from **capital expenditures (CapEx)** to **operating expenses (OpEx)**. 

- **CapEx** involves **upfront costs** for fixed assets, like servers and cooling systems, that benefit the business for years. Maintaining these assets also counts as CapEx.
- Small businesses often find CapEx challenging due to high one-time costs, which can limit cash flow.

- **OpEx**, on the other hand, consists of **recurring costs** for immediate benefits, such as subscriptions for cloud services and website hosting.

**Cost Management Approach:**  
Understanding CapEx and OpEx helps clarify cost differences between on-premises systems and the cloud.

- In the **CapEx model**, budgeting is an annual process requiring significant upfront investment in data centers, including space and equipment.
- **Forecasting** is based on historical growth to predict future needs.

**Benefits of Cloud's OpEx Model:**  
With the cloud's **pay-as-you-go approach**, organizations only pay for what they use:

- Budgeting becomes an **ongoing process** rather than a one-time annual task.
- Spending must be monitored continuously due to the dynamic nature of cloud services.

**Decentralized Resource Creation:**  
In a cloud environment, any employee can quickly create resources on infrastructure managed by a cloud provider, leading to:

- Savings on **power, cooling, and space**.
- Reduced management overhead, as the cloud provider handles installation, upgrades, and troubleshooting.
- No depreciation of equipment, as that responsibility lies with the provider.

**Organic Growth Potential:**  
The cloud allows organizations to start small and grow based on actual usage, making costs operational expenses that match real needs.
