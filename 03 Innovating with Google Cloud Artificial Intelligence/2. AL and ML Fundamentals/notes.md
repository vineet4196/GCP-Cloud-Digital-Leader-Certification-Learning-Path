## AI and ML Defined

People often use **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning (ML)** interchangeably, but they have distinct differences:

1. **Definitions**:
   - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad field that involves technologies enabling machines to mimic human cognitive functions. This includes:
     - Understanding and responding to language.
     - Analyzing data.
     - Making recommendations.
   - **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without explicit programming. It uses models to:
     - Analyze large datasets.
     - Learn from insights.
     - Make predictions and decisions.

2. **Learning Process**:
   - ML algorithms improve as they are trained with more data.
   - The model's output improves with increased data exposure.

3. **Categorization**:
   - Think of AI as an **umbrella term** encompassing various approaches, including ML, deep learning, robotics, expert systems, and natural language processing.
   
4. **Generative AI**:
   - A type of AI that creates new content (text, images, audio, etc.).
   - Google uses generative AI in products like **Google Workspace** for tasks such as generating document summaries.
   - It also offers **generative AI APIs** for developers to create custom applications.

5. **Applications**:
   - Generative AI can be used for:
     - Conversational bots
     - Content generation
     - Document synthesis
     - Product discovery


## How AI and ML differ from data analytics and business intelligence

Within an organization, analysts often rely on **backward-looking data**—like dashboards and monthly reports—that reflect past performance. This historical data is useful for calculating metrics and identifying trends. However, to create real value, organizations must leverage this data for **future decision-making**. 

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning (ML)** play crucial roles in this transformation. For example:

- **Case Study**: Maya, who leads strategy for an international airline, examines historical reports to understand customer purchasing patterns. While she can identify trends and demographic distributions, this approach is merely reactive.
- **Predictive Insights**: If Maya could predict flight satisfaction rates or customer complaints, she could take proactive measures. To achieve this, she would need comprehensive data:
  - Number of passengers per flight
  - Flight duration
  - Customer satisfaction ratings
  - Complaints data
  - External factors like weather and seasonal trends

With these data points, Maya could generate predictive insights for all flights year-round. This capability would allow her to dynamically adjust:
- Pricing
- Staffing
- Catering

**Key Takeaway**: By utilizing machine learning, Maya can uncover predictive insights that enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction, demonstrating the transformative power of AI and ML in decision-making.


## Problems that ML Is suited to solve

**Machine Learning (ML)** allows computer systems to continuously improve as they gain more experience. The accuracy of ML increases with more data. It is suited to solve four common business problems:

1. **Replacing or Simplifying Rule-Based Systems**:
   - **Example**: Google Search faced complexities in handling search queries (e.g., "Giants"). Previously, it used hand-coded rules based on user location.
   - **Solution**: ML models can analyze user click data to predict and rank search results, making the process more efficient.

2. **Automating Processes**:
   - **Example**: Ananda Development in Thailand streamlined property inspections. Inspectors previously manually checked properties, which was time-consuming and error-prone.
   - **Implementation**: They developed a mobile app using Google's speech-to-text API to document inspections and later incorporated drones with Cloud Vision API to capture and classify defects.
   - **Result**: Saved 130 hours and over $100,000 in costs, improving efficiency and accuracy while providing electronic inspection reports to buyers.

3. **Understanding Unstructured Data**:
   - **Example**: Ocado, an online grocery store, improved email handling by using ML to analyze customer emails.
   - **Benefit**: ML identified customer sentiment and topics to route messages to the appropriate departments, enhancing customer experience and satisfaction.

4. **Personalization**:
   - **Example**: YouTube uses ML to recommend videos based on user preferences, improving user engagement.
   - **Application**: Many businesses use similar techniques for personalized product recommendations, content suggestions, and tailored experiences.

**Key Insight**: ML models are not standalone solutions. Addressing complex business challenges often requires a combination of different models. There are numerous applications of machine learning in business, which can be further explored in dedicated ML courses.


## Why ML requires high-quality data

**Machine Learning (ML) relies on data** to derive predictive insights and make repeated decisions. However, the **accuracy of predictions** depends on having large volumes of **high-quality data**. Low-quality data can lead to poor predictions, similar to teaching a child with incorrect information.

To ensure quality data when training an ML model, data should be evaluated against **six dimensions**:

1. **Completeness**:
   - Refers to whether all required information is present.
   - Incomplete data affects the model's ability to learn necessary patterns. 
   - **Example**: Missing transaction dates in a dataset can hinder model training.

2. **Uniqueness**:
   - Data should be unique to avoid confusion.
   - High duplicates can impair accurate pattern identification.
   - **Example**: Training a model on many Labrador images makes it hard to identify other breeds.

3. **Timeliness**:
   - Data must be up-to-date to reflect the current state of the phenomenon.
   - Untimely data leads to irrelevant predictions.
   - **Example**: Using old stock prices to predict current market trends.

4. **Validity**:
   - Data must conform to predefined standards (type and format).
   - Ensures data falls within acceptable ranges.
   - **Example**: A date formatted incorrectly (e.g., 08-12-2019 when the standard is YYYY-MM-DD).

5. **Accuracy**:
   - Reflects the correctness of the data.
   - Inaccurate labeling (e.g., labeling cats as dogs) leads to poor predictions.
   - **Note**: Accuracy focuses on content, while validity focuses on type and format.

6. **Consistency**:
   - Data should be uniform without contradictory information.
   - Inconsistent data (e.g., different names for the same entity) can mislead the model.
   - **Example**: A customer appearing as "John Smith" in one place and "J. Smith" in another.

**Key Insight**: Data is the model's only perspective on the world. If data is incomplete or incorrect, the model will make flawed assumptions. To provide accurate insights, it’s crucial to collect **high-quality data purposefully**.


## The importance of responsible nad explainable AI

**AI has great potential** to tackle challenging problems, such as **advancing medicine**, **understanding language**, and **fueling scientific discovery**. To harness this potential responsibly, Google has established guiding **principles for AI applications**:

1. **Social Benefit**: AI should be beneficial to society.
2. **Bias Avoidance**: It must avoid creating or reinforcing unfair biases.
3. **Safety**: AI should be built and tested for safety.
4. **Accountability**: There should be accountability to people.
5. **Privacy**: Incorporate privacy design principles.
6. **Scientific Excellence**: Uphold high standards of scientific rigor.
7. **Responsible Use**: AI must be available for applications that align with these principles.

**Areas to Avoid**: Google will not design or deploy AI in the following areas:
- Technologies likely to cause overall harm.
- Weapons or technologies intended to cause injury.
- Surveillance technologies violating accepted norms.
- Technologies conflicting with international law and human rights.

**Encouraging Responsible Development**: Google urges other organizations to create their own principles for responsible AI. It's also vital for organizations to:
- **Debug and improve** ML model performance.
- Understand and resolve **bias**, **data drift**, and other model gaps.
- Provide **human interpretable explanations** of ML models to enhance **trust** and **transparency**.

**Explainable AI**: Google Cloud offers tools and frameworks for understanding and interpreting predictions from ML models, ensuring transparent AI development through integration with various Google products and services.
