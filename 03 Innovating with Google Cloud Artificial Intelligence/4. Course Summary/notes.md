## Course Summary

The "Innovating with Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence" course has covered several key topics:

1. **AI and ML Fundamentals**: Participants learned the distinctions between artificial intelligence and machine learning, how machine learning differs from data analytics and business intelligence, and the types of problems suitable for AI solutions. The course emphasized the importance of high-quality data and the need for responsible and explainable AI.

2. **Google Cloud's AI and ML Solutions**: The course introduced various tools, including BigQuery ML, pre-trained APIs, AutoML, and custom models within Vertex AI. It also covered TensorFlow, existing AI solutions, and considerations for selecting Google Cloud AI or ML solutions.

Now that you have a solid foundation in AI and ML on Google Cloud, the next course, "Modernize Infrastructure and Applications with Google Cloud," will focus on the importance of cloud modernization, options for running compute workloads, using containers and serverless computing, the value of APIs, and reasons for hybrid or multi-cloud strategies.
