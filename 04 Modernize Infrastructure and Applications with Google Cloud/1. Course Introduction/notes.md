## Course Introduction

New organizations that are cloud-based are challenging traditional business models. **Scale is now the norm**, not a competitive advantage, which raises questions for older organizations on how to not just survive, but thrive in this new landscape.

The key lies in how these organizations **structure and utilize their IT resources**. They should shift from maintaining their own IT infrastructure to leveraging the cloud, allowing them to focus on creating **higher value products and services**. 

The cloud also enables faster development of applications that enhance engagement with customers and employees. Moreover, companies experience **financial benefits** by adopting a pay-as-you-use model, changing the economics of tech investments.

For many, modernizing infrastructure and applications is essential for **digital transformation**. The course on "Modernized Infrastructure and Applications with Google Cloud" aims to introduce **common terminology**, explore options for running workloads in the cloud (like virtual machines, containers, and serverless architecture), and examine methods for **modernizing application development** through rehosting and APIs. 

Participants will need to complete graded assessments to receive course credit. 

**Main Points:**

- New cloud-based organizations challenge traditional models.
- Scale is the new standard.
- Older organizations must adapt to thrive.
- Shift focus from maintaining IT to leveraging cloud resources.
- Cloud allows for development of high-value products and improved customer engagement.
- Financial benefits from a pay-as-you-use model.
- Course focuses on infrastructure and application modernization with Google Cloud.

## Importance cloud migrating terms



When learning about modernizing infrastructure and applications in the Cloud, you'll come across several key terms:

1. **Workload**: In cloud computing, a workload refers to a specific application, service, or capability that can be run in the cloud or on-premises, including containers, databases, and virtual machines.

2. **Retiring Workloads**: This means removing a workload from a platform due to reasons like being unnecessary, cost-ineffective, insecure, or incompatible.

3. **Retaining Workloads**: This involves intentionally keeping a workload, usually on-premises or in a hybrid cloud environment, allowing the business to manage it independently.

4. **Rehosting**: This is the migration of a workload to the cloud without changing its code or architecture, often called **lift and shift**. While it's a simple and quick method, it may not utilize all cloud benefits effectively.

5. **Replatforming**: This process migrates a workload to the cloud while making some changes to its code or architecture, known as **move and improve**. It helps leverage cloud advantages like scalability and cost-effectiveness, but can be complex and time-consuming.

6. **Refactoring**: This involves changing the workload's code to utilize cloud-based architectures, such as microservices or serverless. Refactoring can enhance efficiency and scalability but also requires significant effort.

7. **Reimagining**: This term refers to rethinking how organizations use technology to achieve business goals, potentially involving a new cloud strategy or integrating technologies like AI and machine learning. This can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve agility.

**Main Points:**
- Workloads are key applications/services in cloud computing.
- Workloads can be retired, retained, rehosted, replatformed, refactored, or reimagined.
- Rehosting is simple but limited in cloud benefits.
- Replatforming and refactoring improve cloud efficiency but can be complex.
- Reimagining helps organizations align technology with business goals.
